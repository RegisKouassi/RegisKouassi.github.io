## Working papers 
###   “Water-Proofed: Floods and Water Infrastructure Quality in the United-States” (Job Market Paper)
<p>This paper studies the role of water infrastructure as a means of adaptation to climate change. 
Specifically, I investigate how past investments in water infrastructure mitigate the economic effects of floods across U.S. counties. 
I construct a simple statistical framework to aggregate in a structured way detailed information on the entire population 
of rain and local flood events in the conterminous U.S. between 1996 and 2019. The analysis exploits an Amendment to the 
Clean Water Act (CWA) in 1977, as an exogenous shifter in sewer system quality, to identify its effect on flood occurrence. 
Results indicate that, absent restrictions imposed by the Amendment, the number of damaging floods occurring would have been lower by 10%. 
Moreover, I estimate a flood mitigation benefit-to-cost ratio of 9 to 1 associated with an improvement in sewer systems quality,
 saving nearly $22.6 million for the average county.</p>

### Measuring the Economic Costs of China’s zero-COVID Policy from Outer Space, (With Jian tang)
<p>
We quantify the effects of the “zero-COVID” policy using a rich set of county-level lockdown events in China and nighttime satellite imagery. 
We find that more stringent lockdowns induce a large contemporaneous decline in nightlight followed by a slow recovery, 
which happens at least two quarters after lockdown enactment. Absent widespread contagions, a county under total lockdown 
incurs on average a 6% GDP loss compared to those without restrictions. The negative effect is particularly persistent in
 service-heavy areas as opposed to manufacturing-heavy areas. There exists some evidence consistent with spillover effects near 
 counties under lockdown, but these effects are short-lived.
